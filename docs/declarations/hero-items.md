# Hero items and recipient effects

The 30 tiered items live in `content/game.json`. `src/content/items.ts` defines the vocabulary. There are ten items per tier; item IDs are data and are never dispatched on by simulation or presentation.

## Authoring

An equipment item retains `damage`, `armor`, and `maxHp`. Optional `modifiers` add mana, regeneration, attack/movement speed, lifesteal, or ability cooldown reduction. Permille values use 1000 = 100%. Ordinary equipment stats stack as before. Total movement is clamped to 20–180% of base, lifesteal to 40%, and cooldown reduction to 40%.

`active` declares self/allied/enemy targeting, radius in map tiles, cooldown in ticks, optional charges, healing/mana, damage and damage type, timed status/shield, or remaining ability cooldown reduction. One second is 40 simulation ticks. Self actions use radius zero. Area actions affect living, active units; they do not affect buildings or units inside production structures. Roots prevent movement but not attacks. Control immunity suppresses roots and stuns while active.

`aura` declares radius, relationship and modifiers. Auras include their bearer if allied. They are recomputed before regeneration and after movement; leaving range, losing the item, entering a structure, or the source dying removes the aura on the next simulation refresh. Identical item auras do not stack, including different bearers. Different auras stack. Teams are respected; neutral creatures do not become allies merely because their owner is `none`.

`onHit` declares an every-N-basic-hit pulse centered on the struck target, with radius, target cap, damage type and flat or attack-scaled damage. Identical attack-trigger items do not multiply triggers. Pulses do not recursively trigger more pulses or lifesteal. Shielded/invulnerable hits do not produce healing or procs. Lifesteal uses effective basic damage capped at the target's remaining health.

`rescue` declares charges, restored maximum-health fraction and a brief invulnerability duration. It intercepts a lethal hit in the normal death pipeline; it is not a resurrection after death. Phoenix Chrysalis breaks after one rescue. Hourglass of Amber subtracts 12 seconds from remaining hero ability cooldowns, never item cooldowns. It is not a full reset.

## Runtime and presentation

`equipment` remains the stable array of item IDs. Parallel optional `equipmentState` stores charges, next ready tick and attack counter. Dropped ground items carry the same runtime in `item.runtime`. Expended items disappear. Charges and cooldowns survive pickup, dropping, save/load and hero revival. Duplicate auras and temporary effects refresh by item/kind instead of multiplying. Save validation rejects undeclared status kinds, invalid charge counts, excessive shields and forged queued item damage.

Public `itemStatuses` on observed recipients drive both the small world badges and center-panel status icons. Hover/focus a panel badge to see actual modifiers, aura range, remaining shield and remaining time. These statuses do not reveal private enemy inventories or hidden units. Inventory tiles show tier borders, charges and seconds until ready. AI evaluates active items from their declarations and respects their cooldowns.

## Loot

Pools declare `maxTier`; validation rejects entries above it. Easy camps draw T1. Medium and ordinary hard camps draw T2. Only explicitly `legendary: true` camps may use a pool containing T3. Map validation allows at most three potential T3 camp rewards. Amberfall Wilds designates its three highest-experience hard camps (23, 17, 18); each awards one T3. Maps without legendary camps award no T3. The planned endgame map will contain all three tiers and a contested amber root.

## Icons and checks

All thirty icons ship as painted 128 × 128 PNGs on black backgrounds in `assets/ui/icons/items-v2/`. High-resolution masters, generation prompts and a contact sheet live in `experiments/assets/item-icons/painted-v2/`. Re-export with `python3 scripts/items/export-painted.py` (requires Pillow). The older `items-v1` SVG pipeline is retained only as a legacy source; it does not overwrite the painted set.

Coverage: `tests/game/hero-items.test.ts` exercises every item, aura relationships/range/death, charges, drop/pickup, save/load determinism, shields, roots, immunity, rescue, triggers, lifesteal, cooldowns and UI state. `tests/game/item-assets.test.ts` checks the actual PNGs and legendary map restrictions. Existing inventory, spells, balance, AI and camp tests remain relevant.
